This folder contains the core parts of destriping algorithm,
which are split into different files corresponding to different functions.
The destriping functions are interfaced in destripe.h header file.
Additional two-dimensional array allocation utility subroutines are in allocate_2d.c.

This code was developed in NOAA/NESDIS/STAR SST and Ocean Color groups by Karlis Mikelsons,
and is partially based on an earlier version of destriping algorithm for use with the 
Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data written by Marouan Bouali at NOAA/NESDIS/STAR SST group. 

Please acknowledge any use of these codes in your presentations
and publications by citing the following publications:
