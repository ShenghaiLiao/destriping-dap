This program is designed to destripe MODIS Level 1b data. 

On input, it requires two command line arguments:
First argument should be the name of hdf4 file containing MODIS Level 1b data,
Second argument is the parameter file (sample included in this folder).

On output, the hdf4 file with MODIS Level 1b data is modified - 
the bands that were destriped are replaced by the destriped data.
In addition, it also adds (or updates) a destriping attribute for 
each data field which it has updated with destriped data. 

Besides standard C library functions, this code relies on the main destriping code, through "destripe.h",
as well as following libraries: fftw3 library (float version), HDF4 library (and dependencies, such as libjpeg, libsz, libz),
OpenMP library (such as libiomp5 or libgomp), and libpthread.

The code is designed to run multiple threads using OpenMP. 
The optimal number of threads needs to be set before execution by
setting environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS.
