Each line above describes destriping parameters for a given 
band of MODIS L1b data. band can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12, 13lo, 13hi, 
14lo, 14hi, 15, ... , 36.

For optical  bands 1,, 2, ..., 19, 26, reflectance is destriped.
For emissive bands 20, 21, ..., 25, 27, ..., 36, radiance is 
converted to brightness temperature, which is then detriped, 
and converted back to radiance. 

Ndetectors should normally be equal to 10, 
the number of detectors in a MODIS scan.

niter is number of destriping iterations, niter = 8 is a good
choice for majority of cases.

NEdT is the parameter of non-linear filter, and has to be
adjusted for each band. The units are dimensionless for optical 
bands, and Kelvins^2 for emissive bands.

Thresh_x and Thresh_y are threshold parameters that determine 
what pixels of data get destriped. They refer to maximum absolute 
value of gradient that is considered as "smooth" for destriping
purposes. The units are dimensionless reflectance per pixel 
for optical bands, and Kelvins per pixel for emissive bands.

Tmin, Tmax are minumum and maximum values of data that limit the
range of values of pixels that get destriped. This is primarily 
to exclude from  destriping land, clouds, ice etc. 
The units are dimensionless (reflectance) for optical bands, and 
Kelvins for emissive bands.
