This program is designed to destripe VIIRS Level 1b (SDR) data. 

On input, it requires two command line arguments:
First argument should be the name of hdf5 file containing VIIRS SDR data,
Second argument is the parameter file (sample included in this folder).

On output, the hdf5 file with VIIRS SDR data is modified - 
the original data are replaced by the destriped data.
In addition, it includes a destriping attribute under data field
Data_Products/VIIRS-M??-SDR/VIIRS-M??-SDR_Aggr. 
The name of destriping attribute is DestripingBrightnessTemperature for bands 12-16,
and it is DestripingReflectance for bands 1-11.

Besides standard C library functions, this code relies on the main destriping code, through "destripe.h",
as well as following libraries: fftw3 library (float version), HDF5 library (and dependencies, such as libsz, libz),
OpenMP library (such as libiomp5 or libgomp), and libpthread.

The code is designed to run multiple threads using OpenMP. 
The optimal number of threads needs to be set before execution by
setting environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS.
