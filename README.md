Destriping algorithm for VIIRS/MODIS Ocean Products.

This software was developed by the SST group at NOAA STAR (Lead:
A. Ignatov).

### Algorithm Design: 
Marouan Bouali (Formerly: NOAA STAR and CIRA, USA; Currently: U. San
Paolo, Brazil)

### Consultant(s):
Alexander Ignatov (NOAA STAR, USA)
Yuri Kihai (NOAA STAR and GST, USA)

### Senior Software Developer(s): 
Karlis Mikelsons (NOAA STAR and GST, USA)

### The software supported and monitored by:
NOAA STAR SST Team (John Stroup, NOAA STAR and SGT, USA)

### The Algorithm and Software developed, supported and monitored by the NOAA STAR SST Team under:
* JPSS SST project (funded by the JPSS Program Office), and
* Ocean Remote Sensing Program funded by NOAA.

### Use in the NOAA SST Processing:
The destriping code was implemented in NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor
for Oceans (ACSPO) SST processing of VIIRS at MODIS data experimentally in
May 2014, and operationally with S-NPP VIIRS SST product in Decmeber 2014.

### Use in the NOAA Ocean Color Processing:
The destriping code was implemented in NOAA ocean color processing of
VIIRS data experimentally in November 2014.
